# The Palmer Penguins

The data in the `palmerpenguins` package in R includes information on several measurements of interest for adult foraging penguins observed on islands in the Palmer Archipelago near Palmer Station, Antarctica. Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) Program collected the data and made it available[^02-penguins-1]. The data describe three species of penguins, called Adelie, Chinstrap and Gentoo.

[^02-penguins-1]: Two fun facts: (1) Male Gentoo and Adelie penguins "propose" to females by giving them a pebble. (2) The Adelie penguin was named for his wife by Jules Dumont d'Urville, who also rediscovered the Venus de Milo.

## Setup: Packages Used Here

We will use the `palmerpenguins` package to supply us with data for this chapter. The `janitor` packages includes several useful functions, including `tabyl`. The `knitr` package includes the `kable()` function we'll use. Finally, the `tidyverse` package will provide the bulk of the functions we'll use in our work throughout the semester.

I always load the `tidyverse` last, because it solves some problems to do so.


```{r}
#| message = FALSE
knitr::opts_chunk$set(comment = NA)

library(palmerpenguins) 
library(janitor) 
library(knitr) 
library(kableExtra)
library(gt)
library(tidyverse) 

theme_set(theme_bw())
```


## Viewing a Data Set

The `penguins` data from the `palmerpenguins` package contains `r nrow(penguins)` rows and `r ncol(penguins)` columns. Each row contains data for a different penguin, and each column describes a variable contained in the data set.

```{r}
penguins
```

For instance, the first penguin in the data is of the species Adelie, and was observed on the island called Torgeson. The remaining data for that penguin include measures of its bill length and depth, its flipper length and body mass, its sex and the year in which it was observed.

Note that though there are `r nrow(penguins)` rows in the tibble of data called `penguins`, only the first ten rows (penguins) are shown in the table above. Note also that the symbol `NA` or `<NA>` is used to indicate a missing (not available) value.

## Create `new_penguins`: Eliminating Missing Data

Next, let's take the `penguins` data from the `palmerpenguins` package, and identify those observations which have complete data (so, no missing values) in four variables of interest. We'll store that result in a new tibble (data set) called `new_penguins` and then take a look at that result using the following code.

Note that the code below:

-   uses the "pipe" `|>` to send the penguins tibble to the `filter()` function
-   uses `<-` to assign the result of our work to the `new_penguins` tibble
-   uses the `complete.cases()` function to remove cases within `penguins` that have missing data on any of the four variables (`flipper_length_mm`, `body_mass_g`, `species` or `sex`) that we identify

```{r}
new_penguins <- penguins |>
    filter(complete.cases(flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, species, sex))

new_penguins
```

## Counting Things and Making Tables

So, how many penguins are in our `new_penguins` data? When we printed out the result, we got an answer, but (as with many things in R) there are many ways to get the same result.

```{r}
nrow(new_penguins)
```

How do our `new_penguins` data break down by sex and species? We'll use the `tabyl()` function from the `janitor` package to look at this.

```{r}
new_penguins |> 
    tabyl(sex, species) 
```

The output is reasonably clear (there are 73 female and 73 male Adelie penguins in the  `newpenguins` tibble, for example) but could we make that table a little prettier, and while we're at it, can we add the row and column totals?

```{r}
new_penguins |> 
    tabyl(sex, species) |>
    adorn_totals(where = c("row", "col")) |> # add row, column totals
    kable()  # one convenient way to make the table prettier
```

The `kable()` function comes from the `knitr` package we loaded earlier. Notice that we added some comments to the code here with the prefix `#`. These comments are ignored by R in processing the data.

Another approach we could have used here is aided by the `kableExtra` package's function called `kbl()`, which lets us set up the alignment of our columns. We'll also add the species name using `adorn_title()` from the `janitor` package.

```{r}
new_penguins |> 
    tabyl(sex, species) |>
    adorn_totals(where = c("row", "col")) |> 
    adorn_title(placement = "combined") |>
    kbl(align = c('lcccr')) |>
    kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)
```

We can switch the rows and columns, and add some additional features, using the code below, which makes use of the `gt()` and `tab_header()` functions from the `gt` package, which is designed to help build complex tables. More on the incredibly versatile `gt()` package is available at <https://gt.rstudio.com/>.

```{r}
new_penguins |> 
    tabyl(species, sex) |>
    adorn_totals(where = c("row", "col")) |> 
    gt() |>
    tab_header(
      title = md("Palmer Penguins in **newpenguins**"),
      subtitle = "Comparing sexes by species"
    )
```

## Creating a Scatterplot

Now, let's look at the other two variables of interest. Let's create a graph showing the association of body mass with flipper length across the complete set of `r nrow(new_penguins)` penguins.

```{r}
#| message = FALSE
ggplot(new_penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm)) +
    geom_point() 
```

Some of you may want to include a straight-line model (fit by a classical linear regression) to this plot. One way to do that in R involves the addition of a single line of code, like this:

```{r}
#| message = FALSE
ggplot(new_penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x,
                col = "red", se = FALSE)
```

Whenever we build a graph for ourselves, these default choices may be sufficient. But I'd like to see a prettier version if I was going to show it to someone else. So, I might use a different color for each species, and I might add a title, like this.

```{r}
ggplot(new_penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm, col = species)) +
    geom_point() + 
    labs(title = "Flipper Length and Body Mass for 333 of the Palmer Penguins")
```

## Six Ways To "Improve" This Graph

Now, let's build a new graph to incorporate some additional information and improve the appearance. Here, I want to:

1.  plot the relationship between body mass and flipper length in light of both Sex and Species
2.  increase the size of the points and add a little transparency so we can see if points overlap,
3.  add some smooth curves to summarize the relationships between the two quantities (body mass and flipper length) within each combination of species and sex,
4.  split the graph into two "facets" (one for each sex),
5.  improve the axis labels,
6.  improve the titles by adding a subtitle, and also adding in some code to count the penguins (rather than hard-coding in the total number.)

```{r}
#| message = FALSE
ggplot(new_penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm, 
                         col = species)) +
    geom_point(size = 2, alpha = 0.5) + 
    geom_smooth(method = "loess", formula = y ~ x, 
                se = FALSE, size = 1.5) +
    facet_grid(~ sex) +
    labs(title = "Flipper Length and Body Mass, by Sex & Species",
         subtitle = str_glue(nrow(new_penguins), " of the Palmer Penguins"),
         x = "Body Mass (g)", 
         y = "Flipper Length (mm)")
```

## A Little Reflection

What can we learn from these plots and their construction? In particular,

-   What do these plots suggest about the center of the distribution of each quantity (body mass and flipper length) overall, and within each combination of Sex and Species?
-   What does the final plot suggest about the spread of the distribution of each of those quantities in each combination of Sex and Species?
-   What do the plots suggest about the association of body mass and flipper length across the complete set of penguins?
-   How does the shape and nature of this body mass - flipper length relationship change based on Sex and Species?
-   Do you think it would be helpful to plot a straight-line relationship (rather than a smooth curve) within each combination of Sex and Species in the final plot? Why or why not? (Also, what would we have to do to the code to accomplish this?)
-   How was the R code for the plot revised to accomplish each of the six "wants" specified above?

## Coming Up

Next, we'll introduce and demonstrate some more of the many available tools for creating summaries (both graphical and numerical) in R, again working with the Palmer Penguins data.
