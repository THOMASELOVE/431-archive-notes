# Session Information

It is often helpful to include a summary of your R session, specifically some information about your operating system, the version of R and the packages you made use of in creating your document.

We demonstrate two approaches to including this below, each of which you'll use in submitting Lab and Project assignments over the course of the semester.

## Using sessionInfo()

One approach is to use the `sessionInfo()` function available in base R.

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```


## Using session_info() 

Another approach is to use the `session_info()` function available in the `sessioninfo` package. Professor Love has a slight preference for this approach, but it's not an important distinction to make.

```{r}
sessioninfo::session_info()
```
